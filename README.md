The way to use Facebook native login on iOS 9, instead of Safari View Controller

From Facebook SDK version 4.6, Facebook uses Safari View Controller to login on iOS 9 instead of Facebook native app like before. They explain why here: https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2015/10/29/Facebook-Login-iOS9/

But i (maybe you too) don't think it is a good idea. Some one even show the proof how it affects to his app (http://stackoverflow.com/a/33155960)

So i write this. Hope Facebook update their SDK soon and let developer can decine the login behavior for their own app.

## How to use

Just import those file into your project and you're ready to go. Enjoy it!
